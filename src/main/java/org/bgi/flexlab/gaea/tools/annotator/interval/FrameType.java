/**
 * Type of frame calculations
 * Internally, we use GFF style frame calculation for Exon / Transcript
 *
 * Technically, these are 'frame' and 'phase' which are calculated in different ways
 *
 * 		UCSC type: Indicated the coding base number modulo 3. This is the 'classical' definition of frame).
 *
 * 		GFF/GTF type: Indicates the number of bases that should be removed from the beginning
 * 				of this feature to reach the first base of the next codon.
 * 					0) indicates that the feature begins with a whole codon at the 5' most base.
 * 					1) means that there is one extra base (the third base of a codon) before the first whole codon and
 * 					2) means that there are two extra bases (the second and third bases of the codon) before the first codon
 * 				Sometimes this is called 'phase' instead of frame, to distinguish form
 * 				the previous definition.
 *
 * Valid numbers are {-1, 0, 1, 2}, where -1 indicates 'unknown'

	 * What frame means:
	 * 		'0' indicates that the specified region is in frame, i.e. that
	 * 			its first base corresponds to the first base of a codon.
	 *
	 * 		'1' indicates that there is one extra base, i.e. that the
	 * 			second base of the region corresponds to the first base of a codon
	 *
	 * 		'2' means that the third base of the region is the first base of a
	 * 			codon.
	 *
	 * If the strand is '-', then the first base of the region is value of 'end', because
	 * the corresponding coding region will run from <end> to <start> on the reverse strand.
	 *
	 * Frame is calculated as (3 - ((length-frame) mod 3)) mod 3:
	 * Here is why:
	 * 		(length-frame) is the length of the previous feature starting at the first whole codon (and thus the frame subtracted out).
	 * 		(length-frame) mod 3 is the number of bases on the 3' end beyond the last whole codon of the previous feature.
	 * 		3-((length-frame) mod 3) is the number of bases left in the codon after removing those that are represented at the 3' end of the feature.
	 * 		(3-((length-frame) mod 3)) mod 3 changes a 3 to a 0, since three bases makes a whole codon, and 1 and 2 are left unchanged.
